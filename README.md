As student of NHL Stenden you use different platforms. For example Xedule for your schedules, Blackboard for the course information and Progress for your grades.

I used a shortcut link for these platforms, but needed to login every time to actually use them. I'm knew it could be simplified. That's why I created this app. After creating the Xedule part, someone told me it would be nice to have the same for e-mail, so I extended the app to handle email as well as Xedule. In the current version you can use Xedule, check your email find courcse information and you can see your grades using Progress.
