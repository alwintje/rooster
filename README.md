# Schedule

As student of NHL Stenden, you use some platforms. You probably use Xedule for your schedules, Blackboard for the course information and progress for your grades.

I was having a shortcut to my schedule on my device and everytime I must login to see my schedule. I'm lazy and thought it could be simplified. That's why I made this app. Someone told me "It would be nice to have the same for your e-mail" and I thought 'Why not?'. That's the rease why I have expand the app. Now you can see your schedule, check your e-mail, find course information and see your grades.
